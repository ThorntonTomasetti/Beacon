### Branch

The branching model in use is described [here](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). The repository contains two branches:

- `master` - the production/release branch (stable code)
- `develop` - the branch containing the latest development changes (pre-release code)

Please base your work on the `develop` branch.
